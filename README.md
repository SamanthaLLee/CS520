# CS520: Introduction to AI 

## Project 1

An agent is put into an NxN maze and attempts to reach the goal using a repeated A* algorithm.

## Project 2

An agent is put into an NxN and learns about its environment through logical inference. As it attempts to reach the goal using a repeated A* algorithm, it maintains a knowledge base that updates with new information every move.

## Project 3

An agent is put into an NxN maze where each available location has one of three terrains. The probability of the agent accurately detecting an unknown goal cell depends on the terrain type. The agent learns about its environment and uses probability to identify (1) the cell with the highest chance of containing the target and (2) the cell that gives the agent the highest chance of successfully finding the target. Using a repeated A* algorithm, the agent examines cells and updates probabilities until it finds the goal.

## Project 4

We built four neural networks to mimic the original agent from project 1 and the logical inference agent from project 2. For each project, we developed, trained, and, tested a model with full dense layers and a convolutional neural network.
